# Jenkins | Security Scanning Kubernetes Cluster & Workloads Hygiene

Alcide Advisor is an agentless Kubernetes audit, compliance and hygiene scanner thatâ€™s built to ensure a friction free DevSecOps workflows. Alcide Advisor can be plugged early in the development process and before moving to production.

With Alcide Advisor, the security checks you can cover includes:

- Kubernetes infrastructure vulnerability scanning.
- Hunting misplaced secrets, or excessive priviliges for secret access.
- Workload hardening from Pod Security to network policies.
- Istio security configuration and best practices.
- Ingress Controllers for security best practices.
- Kubernetes API server access privileges.

## Jenkins Integration

#### Prerequisites 

Alcide Kubernetes Advisor runs against a kubernetes cluster and requires access to `kubeconfig`
to authenticate & authorize itself to the cluster.

If your pipeline can run kubectl commands against the cluster successfully - you should be ready to initiate a scan.

```Jenkinsfile
import jenkins.model.*
import hudson.AbortException

pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build + Test') {
            steps {
                echo "Build + Test your code"
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
