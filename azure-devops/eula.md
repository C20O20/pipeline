*   **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION**

Each party agrees to keep confidential and to use only for purposes of performing its obligation under this EULA or as otherwise permitted under this EULA, any proprietary or confidential information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this EULA which is marked as confidential or is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or which would reasonably be considered confidential or proprietary in nature. The obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information which; (i) is already known to the receiving party at the time of disclosure, which knowledge, the receiving party shall have the burden of proving with written dated documentation; (ii) is, or, through no act, or failure to act, of the receiving party, becomes publicly known; (iii) is legally received by receiving party from a third party without restriction on disclosure, as evidenced by written dated documentation; (iv) is independently developed by receiving Party without reference to the confidential information of the disclosing party, as evidenced by written dated documentation; or (v) is approved for release by written authorization of the disclosing party. Further, the receiving party may disclose confidential information which is required by law, government order or request to be disclosed (provided that the receiving party shall give written notice to the other party prior to such disclosure allowing for the disclosing party to object to such order or request and shall only disclose the exact confidential information or portion thereof specifically requested by such order or request). The receiving party agrees that it shall hold all confidential information in confidence and shall safeguard the confidential information with at least the same degree of care that it takes to protect its own information of a similar nature, which in no event shall be less than a reasonable standard of care. The parties acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information may give rise to irreparable injury, which may not be adequately compensated by money damages and that the disclosing party shall be entitled to seek specific performance or injunctive relief (as appropriate) as a remedy for any breach or threatened breach thereof, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, User acknowledges and agrees that the Licensed Products and any information related thereto shall be deemed to constitute confidential information of Alcide.

*   **INDEMNIFICATION**

*   **Alcide’s Indemnification Obligations.** Alcide shall defend, indemnify and hold User and its employees, officers and directors harmless at Alcide’s sole cost and expense, for any claim, suit or proceeding, finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction, brought against User which alleges that the Licensed Product, as delivered and used in accordance with the terms of this EULA, infringes any third-party patent, copyright or other intellectual property right. Alcide will pay the amount of any such adverse final judgment or settlement, provided that User gives Alcide written notice promptly following receipt of notice of such claim, suit or proceeding, allows Alcide to assume full control of the defense and settlement of the claim, and full information and reasonable assistance in its defense or settlement. Alcide shall be entitled to settle or otherwise dispose of such claim, suit or proceeding as it sees fit, provided that any settlement intended to bind User and does not completely relieve User of any liability or that requires User to admit any wrongdoing, shall not be final without User’s written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

*   **User’s Indemnification Obligations.** User shall defend, indemnify and hold Alcide and its employees, officers and directors harmless at User’s sole cost and expense, for any claim, suit or proceeding brought against Alcide arising from User’s willful misconduct, gross negligence, breach of confidentiality obligations, and Section 2 of this EULA. User will pay the amount of any adverse final judgment or settlement, provided that Alcide gives User written notice promptly following receipt of notice of such claim, suit or proceeding, and full information and reasonable assistance in its defense or settlement. User shall be entitled to direct such defense and to settle or otherwise dispose of such claim, suit or proceeding as it sees fit, provided that any settlement intended to bind User shall not be final without User’s written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

*   Without in any way limiting Alcide’s obligations to indemnify and defend User under Section 7.1, if an injunction is obtained in such action against User's use of the Licensed Product, or if Alcide is expecting such injunction to be brought, Alcide shall, at its option and expense, either: (i) obtain for User the right to continue to use the Licensed Product; (ii) replace the Licensed Product with a product with substantially equivalent functionality; or (iii) modify the Licensed Product so that it becomes non-infringing, while maintaining substantially equivalent functionality.  If (i), (ii) or (iii) above are not commercially practical, then Alcide shall refund amounts up to the license fees paid for the infringing Licensed Product based on straight-line amortization of the Licensed Product over a five (5) year period beginning on the due date for the license fees.  This Section 8 states Alcide’s entire liability and User's exclusive remedy for infringement.

*   **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.** EXCEPT FOR EITHER PARTY’S OBLIGATIONS OF CONFIDENTIALITY, (i) TO THE EXTENT

PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WHATEVER THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE BASIS FOR THE CLAIM, NEITHER PARTY, NOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR SUPPLIERS, WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF GOODWILL, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, LOSS OF DATA OR BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES) ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED PRODUCT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF SUCH POSSIBILITY WAS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE, (ii) EXCEPT FOR USER’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OR BREACH OF SECTION 2, EITHER PARTY’S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS EULA WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LICENSE FEES PAID FOR THE LICENSED PRODUCT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION WILL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY CAUSED BY EITHER PARTY’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

*   **TERM AND TERMINATION.** The User will have the rights set forth herein for so long as the User complies with the terms of this EULA and any applicable ordering document. This EULA automatically terminates if User breaches its terms and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days of Alcide’s written notice of breach or is not able to be cured. Sections 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11 will survive any termination or expiration of this EULA.

*   **Return or Destruction of Licensed Product and Documentation upon Termination of License****.** If any license granted under this EULA is terminated in accordance with the terms of this EULA, User must cease using the Licensed Product and Documentation. This requirement applies to copies of the Licensed Product and Documentation in all forms, partial and complete, in and on all types of media and computer memory, and whether or not modified or merged into other materials.

*   **GENERAL**

*   In the event any provision or part of this EULA is held to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be amended to the extent required to render it valid, legal and enforceable, or deleted if no such amendment is feasible, and such amendment or deletion shall not affect the enforceability of the other provisions hereof.  

*   No waiver of any breach of this EULA will be a waiver of any other breach, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving Party. The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of future breaches.  

*   **Entire Agreement.** This EULA, including any referenced written addenda, Order Forms and exhibits constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all previous agreements or representations, written or oral, with respect to its subject matter. This EULA may not be modified or amended except in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of each Party.

The Parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction in Tel Aviv, Israel. The Parties specifically exclude application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods to this EULA.  

*   **Informal Dispute Resolution.** Except for the right of either Party to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief, if any dispute arises between the Parties, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve such dispute among themselves prior to resorting to any formal legal action. Either Party may notify the other Party in writing of the occurrence of a dispute and establish a mutually convenient time and place to discuss the dispute. In any event, the meeting shall occur within a commercially reasonable period of time (which period shall not exceed fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice) and shall take place between Alcide’s appointed individual and User’s equivalent representative. If the meeting does not resolve the dispute, either Party may then give the other Party written notice that the dispute continues. Within a commercially reasonable period of time after such notice, which period shall not exceed fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, designated executives of both Parties shall meet to discuss the issue at a mutually convenient time and place. Such executives of each Party shall be a senior executive of such Party. If the dispute has not been resolved within a reasonable period of time thereafter, then either Party may pursue applicable remedies under this EULA, at law, or in equity.
